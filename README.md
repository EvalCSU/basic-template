## Core

EvalCSU will provide you with most of the course design demonstrations, which means there is no need for you to search through the trash for refreshments.

By the way, this doesn't mean that you can just copy our code to achieve high results. We will control the completion level of the demo so that it is only B. 

More importantly, EvalCSU wants you to see it as a basic version, and do your best to bring it to life from your thinking.

<p align="center">Welcome to light up stars for every repo of EvalCSU!</p>

## Landscape

**DONE**

**TO-DO**

  - [ ] Java
- SOA

## Contribution

1. Make sure English is your first language for project presentations. Besides, create Chinese version like `README-zh.md`.
2. Make sure there are enough .md to clarify the princinple of your code. Otherwise, there is nothing different with trash.
3. Make sure the professionalism of the homepage, it should have the following basic sections. As well, you could extend it.
    ```

4. Hope open the Discussion for technical exchange. Be stronger together.
5. Hope build code structure more professionally. For example, you can build as follow with Java. 
    ```
    ├── AndroidManifest.xml
    ├── res
    └── java
         └── net.micode.notes
              ├── data
              ├── model
              ├── tool
              ├── ui
              ├── widget
              └── gtask
                  ├── data
                  ├── exception
                  └── remote
    ```
